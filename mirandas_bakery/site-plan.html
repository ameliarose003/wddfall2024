        <h2>Style Guide</h2>

        <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
        Palette URL:
        <a href="https://coolors.co/e9623b-85c1aa-604c26-5c1833" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/e9623b-85c1aa-604c26-5c1833</a>

        <table class="colors">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>Primary</th>
                    <th>Secondary</th>
                    <th>Accent 1</th>
                    <th>Accent 2</th>
                </tr>
                <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
                <tr>
                    <td class="primary">#5C1833</td>
                    <td class="secondary">#E9623B</td>
                    <td class="accent1">#85C1AA</td>
                    <td class="accent2">#604C26</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->
        I chose "Kurale", serif for the header and "Montserrat Alternates", serif for the paragraph. I chose these because I felt it matched the overall audience of a genreal everyone. 
        <h4>
            Heading Font: "Kurale", serif
            <!-- change this -->
        </h4>
        <h4>
            Paragraph Font: "Montserrat Alternates", serif
            <!-- change this -->
        </h4>
        <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
            Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
            here
        </p>

        <h3>Home</h3>
        <p>
            The home page will include a "welcome to the site" paragraph and a search bar to search the different goodies sold. 
            On the side there will be image links to specials on the Menu page.
            I plan on adding a big image to the start that has the welcome sign on it to make it more interesting and then they can scroll
            down to see the rest of the page with the search bar for the treats that are wanted.
        </p>

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            The about page will include a picture of the owner of the bakery and her story of how it started, as well as contact info etc. There will also be the large image on this page, I'm still deciding to add it on both or just this one.
        </p>
        <img src="images/about_wireframe.jpg" alt="about page wireframe">
        
        <h3>Menu</h3>
        <p>
            The Menu page will include the deals and specials in general and weekly with attatched images that make them look delicious.</p>

            The menu page will include the images and descriptions of the different treats that the bakery offers.
