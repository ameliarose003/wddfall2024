                    <p>
                        Meet Miranda, the heart and hands behind The Cottage Bakery! 
                        At just 16 years old, Miranda brings her passion for baking to 
                        life in her small-town kitchen in Cameron. Inspired by her love 
                        for creating homemade treats and sharing them with her community, 
                        she has turned her dream into a delightful reality. Every pastry, 
                        cake, and loaf of bread reflects her dedication to quality and 
                        the warmth of home. Miranda is excited to bring a little sweetness 
                        to your day, one delicious bite at a time!
